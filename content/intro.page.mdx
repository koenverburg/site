# Hi, I'm Koen

I'm a Senior Software Engineer, hacker and [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) user. I currently work at [Adidas](https://www.adidas-group.com/en/),
here I focus on Payment Experience for the global webshop, I also teach, speak and mentor Junior Engineers.

From time to time I also like to [stream on twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/conradtheprogrammer) and I share my day to day over at [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/conradtheprogrammer).
And I also share tips and tricks on Neovim over at [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@conradtheprogrammer).
